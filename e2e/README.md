# E2E

E2E contains tests using the client and server written in the same language.

For example:

 - Go Client calling Go server: "go test" or "yarn test:go"
 - TypeScript client calling TypeScript server: "yarn test:js"

For cross-language tests, i.e. Ts <-> Go, see [integration](../integration).
